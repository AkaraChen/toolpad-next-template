1. Remember to use MUI feature rather than native HTML feature. For example, you should use `sx` property rather than `className` and `style`.
2. Always use latest MUI feature, such as new Grid component introduced in MUI v5, you should not use `<Grid item>`.
3. Use MUI layout component like `Stack`.
