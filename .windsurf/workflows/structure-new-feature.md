# How to Add a New Feature

This guide outlines the steps to add a new feature to the project, adhering to its modular architecture. Following these conventions is crucial for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.

### Important: File Naming Convention

-   All filenames must use **kebab-case** (e.g., `my-component.tsx`, `api-client.ts`).
-   This ensures consistency and improves readability across the project.

## Step 1: Create the Feature Module

All features are encapsulated within their own directories in the `modules` folder. Start by creating a new directory for your feature.

```bash
# Replace <feature-name> with a descriptive, kebab-case name
mkdir modules/<feature-name>
```

Inside this new directory, create the standard subdirectories:

- `components`: For feature-specific React components.
- `hooks`: For feature-specific React hooks.
- `utils`: For feature-specific utility functions.
- `api`: For all data-fetching logic (if needed).

## Step 2: Develop the Main Feature Component

Create the main component for your feature. While you can create multiple components in the `components` directory, it's good practice to have a primary entry point component, often named `index.tsx` directly within your feature module directory.

**File Path:** `modules/<feature-name>/index.tsx`

```tsx
// modules/<feature-name>/index.tsx
'use client'

import React from 'react'
import { Box, Typography } from '@mui/material'

const FeatureComponent = () => {
    return (
        <Box>
            <Typography variant='h4'>Welcome to the New Feature!</Typography>
            {/* Your feature's UI and logic go here */}
        </Box>
    )
}

export default FeatureComponent
```

## Step 3: Implement API Logic (If Required)

If your feature needs to communicate with a backend, organize your API files within the `api` directory.

1.  **API Types (`api/types.ts`):** Define all TypeScript types related to your API requests and responses.
2.  **Client-Side Fetching (`api/client.ts`):** Implement client-side data fetching logic here. **Crucially, all asynchronous operations must use TanStack Query (`useQuery`, `useMutation`)** to ensure consistent caching, state management, and error handling.
3.  **Server-Side Logic (`api/server.ts`):** Place server-side logic, such as Next.js API route handlers, in this file.

## Step 4: Create the Page Route

To make your feature accessible, create a corresponding route in the `app` directory.

1.  Create a new directory in `app` that matches your feature's name.

    ```bash
    mkdir app/<feature-name>
    ```

2.  Inside this directory, create a `page.tsx` file. This file should be a lightweight wrapper that does nothing more than import and render your main feature component.

3.  Create a `layout.tsx` file to ensure a consistent layout with the rest of the application. You can copy the contents of `app/(home)/layout.tsx` as a starting point.

    **File Path:** `app/<feature-name>/layout.tsx`

    ```tsx
    // app/<feature-name>/layout.tsx
    import * as React from 'react'
    import { DashboardLayout } from '@toolpad/core/DashboardLayout'
    import { PageContainer } from '@toolpad/core'

    export default function Layout(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        return (
            <DashboardLayout>
                <PageContainer>{props.children}</PageContainer>
            </DashboardLayout>
        )
    }
    ```

    **File Path:** `app/<feature-name>/page.tsx`

    ```tsx
    // app/<feature-name>/page.tsx
    import FeatureComponent from '@/modules/<feature-name>'

    export default function FeaturePage() {
        return <FeatureComponent />
    }
    ```

## Step 5: Leverage the `universal` Module

For any code that can be shared across multiple features, use the `universal` module:

- **Global State:** Use the Zustand store from `modules/universal/store`.
- **Shared Hooks:** Add to and use hooks from `modules/universal/hooks`.
- **Shared Utilities:** Use helpers from `modules/universal/utils`.
- **Global Constants:** Define and use constants from `modules/universal/constants`.

## Step 6: Add Navigation

Finally, add a link to your new feature in the main application navigation to make it discoverable to users. This is done by adding a new entry to the `NAVIGATION` array in `app/layout.tsx`.

By following these steps, you will integrate your new feature cleanly and consistently with the existing project architecture.
